# About 

### What
Vulpem is a technology R&D lab focused on Bitcoin security and trust-minimized application development. We are the creators of [Nigiri CLI](https://nigiri.vulpem.com), [Marina Wallet](https://vulpem.com/marina) and [Liquid Taxi](https://liquid.taxi). We are the maintainers of [Go Elements](github.com/vulpemventures/go-elements) and contributors of [LiquidJS](https://github.com/provable-things/liquidjs-lib)

### Who & Why

A distributed team of software engineers and technologists passionate about self sovereignty, privacy and operational security. We work both for internal funded projects and for clients, we do our best to attract and land only Bitcoin projects.

### How 

We don't focus on a single programming language or stack, we use the best tool to accomplish the goals. 

 A typical internal project would start with an *internal press release* to make clear the product vision to all team members [like AWS does](https://www.product-frameworks.com/Amazon-Product-Management.html), then an appointed *product manager* develops a protoype and writes down the *design rationale*. If we get business approval or market traction, we develop the product with the necessary engineers and the right stack.

We mostly write programs in Go, Python, Javascript, Rust or C. We pack the apps and services with Docker and mostly deploy on AWS if cloud is allowed or ARM-based infrastructure owned by Vulpem. We publish our web services under an Onion hidden service.


### Where

Full remote. No offices. We strive to do an annual gathering of a week once a year accross Europe, with no work related duties, focusing only on wellness activities, midfullness sessions and team building.  

### When

People in Vulpem have possibility to work both with a *regular* full position and to wok with an [extremely distributed software development methodology](https://www.xdsd.org)
